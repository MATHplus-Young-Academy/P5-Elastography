# Estimation of displacements and mechanical tissue properties from Magnetic Resonance Elastography data
MR Elastography is an imaging technique sensitive to tissue mechanics and tissue mechanical properties. Combined with mathematical models, it can be used to estimate biomarkers from low-resolution displacement data. This project targets the development of an automatic pipeline to obtain high-quality displacement images and estimate mechanical parameters applying smoothing and inverse estimators to the complex MRE signal.
