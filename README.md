# Estimation of displacements and mechanical tissue properties from Magnetic Resonance Elastography data
MR Elastography is an imaging technique sensitive to tissue mechanics and tissue mechanical properties. Combined with mathematical models, it can be used to estimate biomarkers from low-resolution displacement data. This project targets the development of an automatic pipeline to obtain high-quality displacement images and estimate mechanical parameters applying smoothing and inverse estimators to the complex MRE signal.

## Background

MR Elastography is a relatively novel techniques that can allow for non invasive characterization of tissue pathologies. In order to use MRE in clinical applications, the raw phase images needs to be processed and converted in to displacement fields that can be then used in the context of mathematical models, inverse problems, or data assimilation frameworks.

These pre-processing steps have the purpose to (i) remove acquisition artifacts, (ii) apply certain transformation to the original signal, (iii) take into account physical properties of the tissue, (iv) smoothing/noise reduction, among others.

This project aims at facilitating the usage of MR images in mathematical models by creating a standard (as much as possible) preprocessing set of routines to be applied to raw data.
